This Readme explains how to create an IP with a 
minimum set of files in Vivado.

###############################
### IP with VHDL files only ###
###############################
1) Create a dummy project in vivado.
2) During project creation, add .vhd/.v files at will
-> NOTE: uncheck the option 'Copy source into project'
3) Tools->Create and Package New IP.
4) Package your current project.
5) Set IP location as desired.
-> NOTE: it is preferred to create an empty directory for this,
where the input source files added previously should also be.
6) Add name and description.
7) Review and Package->Package IP.
8) This should create a folder <ip_name>_0, a folder xgui
and the component.xml files. The folder <ip_name>_0 can
be deleted. The other are the files to be kept.
9) The project used to package the IP can also be deleted.

Edit IP 1:
1) Create dummy project.
2) Add the IP location to the repository in project settings.
3) Open IP Catalog. Search IP.
4) Right-click Edit in IP Packager. That will create a temporary
project for editing and re-packaging the IP.
5) Edit files at will.
6) Review and Package->Re-Package IP.

#################################
### IP with block design (BD) ###
#################################
What is important is to keep the .tcl file to be able to recreate
the block design if modifications are needed.
1) With the project with the block design open, go to File->Export->Block Design.
This will create a .tcl file that can be sourced later to rebuild the BD.
->NOTE: before packaging the project, it is important to right-click create HDL wrapper.
This will create additional .v/.vhd and .xdc files that must be kept to make the IP fully
functional.
2) Go to Tools->Create and Package New Ip.
3) Package your current project.
4) Set IP location as desired. This will create the .xml, a src/
directory with the .xci files for all the instantiated blocks and the usual
xgui folder. This .xci files must be kept versioned to be able to use the block
properly.
5) Keep the previously generated .tcl for sourcing to rebuild the block design.

Edit IP:
1) Create a dummy project. Add the required repositories if the IP uses other
IPs as sublocks. It is better to maintain IPs in adjacent locations instead of
nesting them.
2) With the dummy project open and after having added the required IP repositories,
source bd.tcl to rebuild the block design.
3) Edit the sub-blocks or the Block Design at will.
4) Re-write the current block design to keep in case of future use. For this, go
to File->Export block design as usual.
5) Re package IP as usual.

##############################
### IPs with AXI Interfase ###
##############################
1) Create the IP with the AXI IF as usual. 
2) Before packing the IP, copy all the source files .vhd/.v to the root location where
the IP is going to be.
3) Tools->Create and Package New IP, current project. This will create the src/ directory
in the IP root and copy the .vhd/.v files inside. The files copied before can then be
deleted. This trick is neccessary, otherwise the complex directory tree of Vivado is
used.
-> NOTE: creating the directory src/ and moving the .vhd/.v files inside should also
work and removing the files should not be neccesary.
4) Once IP is packaged, it will contain the .vhd/.v and .xci files.

Edit IP:
1) Open IP Catalog from any project that instantiates the IP.
2) Search the IP. Right click and Edit in IP Packager.
3) Re-package.
