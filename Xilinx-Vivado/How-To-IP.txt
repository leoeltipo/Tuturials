This Readme explains how to create an IP with a 
minimum set of files in Vivado.

###############################
### IP with VHDL files only ###
###############################
1) Create a dummy project in vivado.
2) During project creation, add .vhd/.v files at will
-> NOTE: uncheck the option 'Copy source into project'
3) Tools->Create and Package New IP.
4) Package your current project.
5) Set IP location as desired.
-> NOTE: it is preferred to create an empty directory for this,
where the input source files added previously should also be.
6) Add name and description.
7) Review and Package->Package IP.
8) This should create a folder <ip_name>_0, a folder xgui
and the component.xml files. The folder <ip_name>_0 can
be deleted. The other are the files to be kept.
9) The project used to package the IP can also be deleted.

Edit IP 1:
1) Create dummy project.
2) Add the IP location to the repository in project settings.
3) Open IP Catalog. Search IP.
4) Right-click Edit in IP Packager. That will create a temporary
project for editing and re-packaging the IP.
5) Edit files at will.
6) Review and Package->Re-Package IP.
