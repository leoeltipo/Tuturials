This readme explains how to save the minimum set of files for
versioning in Vivado, and how to re-create the project.

The main idea is to keep only text files and then to re create
the project from scratch for working.

########################
### Saving the files ###
########################
1) Save the IPs as explained in How-To-Ip.txt.
2) Save source files .v/.vhd used in the project.
3) Save .xdc files with constraints.
4) If the project has a block design, open the Block Design (BD)
and execute the command:
-> write_bd_tcl -include_layout <name>.tcl

The option File->Export->Export Block Design does almost the same
thing, but it does not add the -include_layout option which is 
important if the layout of the BD wants to be maintained.

###############################
### Re-Building the project ###
###############################
1) Create a new project. During creation, add hdl and xdc files. Make
sure the option Copy files to project is not checked. This ensures any
modification of the files will be reflected in the original files.
2) Set the part appropriately.
3) With the project open, to to Settings and add the IP repositories.
4) To rebuild the block design, go to Tools->Run Tcl Script and select
the BD created with write_bd_tcl.
-> NOTE: This step can also be executed from the Tcl console sourcing the
Tcl file.
5) Right-click in the recently created block design and create HDL wrapper.

Project should be ready for use.
