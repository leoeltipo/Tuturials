### Change remote url ###
#########################
This trick allows to change the remote even if the current git repo
has a past (commits). Use case:
* A Git repository has been created some time ago. Commits were made
into this repo and after a while, for some reason, the remote wants to
be changed (for example, from github to a private server).
* The following steps must be followed:

1) Create the new repo on the server you want.
2) Clone a clean copy of the repository with the commits you have been
using for a while.
3) In this new cloned directory execute:
-> git remote -v
-> git remote set-url <new-repo-url>.git
-> git remote -v
-> git pull --allow-unrelated-histories

At this point the new repo url should be set. If some conflicts arise,
they should be fixed first and then a new pull must be executed. Once
conflicts are gone:
-> git push

The repository in the new URL now contains all from the other repo, even
the history and commits.
