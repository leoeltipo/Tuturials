Using GIT with Xilinx SDK (my way).

1) Create a repository at GitHub with a readme file.
2) Add files. It is convenient to add a inc/ and src/ directory.
3) Create a SDK the usual way (Export Hardware and Launch SDK).
4) Create an application (Empty app) the usual way.
5) Navigate the Git Console to that location, where the src/ directory is.
6) git init to start a new empty git repository.
7) Register that repo with the remote GitHub repo:
-> git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[reponame].git

8) git pull 
9) git pull git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[reponame].git
10) Now the files are already cloned. 
11) In Xilinx SDK, right click on project name and Refresh.
12) Add inc/ path in project settings.
13) That's it. Commit, push and pull the usual way from command line.
